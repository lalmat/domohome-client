# DomoHome Client

This is a simple client to drive the DomoHome Server written with vueJs and running over ExpressJS.

All you have to do is to set the domoHomeAPI variable to point to the domoHomeAPI installed on a Rapsberry PI. By default, it toggle the pin 7 to On/Off a little led.

If you can light a led, you can rule the world :)

The server (Running on RaspberryPI) is available here :

Have a nice day !
